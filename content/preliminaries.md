## Preliminaries
{:#preliminaries}

[Fern√°ndez et. al. define an _RDF archive_](cite:cites bear) as a set of version-annotated triples,
where a version-annotated triple is an RDF triple that is annotated with a label representing the version in which this triple holds.
A _RDF version_ `i` of an RDF archive is then defined as the set of all triples in the RDF archive that are annotated with the label `i`.

Several approaches exist for archiving Linked Data, which will be further discussed in [](#related-work-archiving).
A survey about archiving [Linked Open Data](cite:cites archiving) categorizes these approaches
into three non-orthogonal storage strategies.
<ol>
    <li>The <em>Independent copies (IC)</em> approach creates separate instantiations of datasets for
each change or set of changes.</li>
    <li>The <em>Change-based (CB)</em> approach instead only stores changes (i.e. changesets) between versions.</li>
    <li>The <em>Timestamp-based (TB)</em> approach stores the temporal validity of facts.</li>
</ol>

The storage of RDF archives typically goes hand-in-hand with querying.
[Five foundational query atoms were introduced](cite:cites bear) that cover the retrieval demands in RDF archiving.
<ol>
    <li><em>Version materialization (VM)</em> retrieves data using queries targeted at a single version.</li>
    <li><em>Delta materialization (DM)</em> retrieves query result differences (i.e. changesets) between two versions.</li>
    <li><em>Version query (VQ)</em> annotates query results with the versions in which they are valid.</li>
    <li><em>Cross-version join (CV)</em> joins the results of two queries between versions.</li>
    <li><em>Change materialization (CM)</em> returns a list of versions in which a given query produces
consecutively different results.</li>
</ol>
As discussed in [previous work](cite:cites tpfarchives), CV and CM queries can be simulated in terms of the other ones.
That is why for the remainder of this article, we will focus on VM, DM and VQ queries.

As [mentioned before](cite:cites tpfarchives), there is a correspondence between the storage strategies and the query atoms.
Namely, VM performs best for storage solutions based on IC, because there is indexing on version.
DM works best for CB solutions, because the deltas are already in the appropriate format for DM query results.
Finally, VQ works best for TB solutions, because the timestamp annotation directly corresponds to VQ's result format.

explain example use cases and figures for VM, DM and VQ (why and how)?
