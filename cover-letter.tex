Please find attached to this letter our submission entitled
\enquote{Triple Storage for Random-Access Versioned Querying of RDF Archives}
for the Special issue on Managing the Evolution and Preservation of the Data Web.
In this article,
we introduce a novel technique for storing RDF archives
that provides a good trade-off between querying efficiency and storage space requirements.
}

In particular, the main contributions of this work are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a new technique for storing RDF archives with two accompanying ingestion algorithms;
  \item querying algorithms for three different version query types on this storage technique;
  \item an open-source implementation of this technique and the querying algorithms;
  \item an extensive evaluation of our approach using an existing RDF archiving benchmark.
\end{itemize}

{\parfillskip 0pt
We hope this article is a good fit for this Special Issue.
Should you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.
We look forward to hearing back from you and thank you in advance
for considering the publication of this work in the Journal of Web Semantics.
